Marriages on the Decline

WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 --- The steeply declining rate at which American women have been bearing children over the last five years slowed and leveled off for the first time in 1974, according to provisional data released today by the National Center for Health Statistics.

At the same time, the center, a unitÅ] of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, reported that, while the American divorce rate continued to rise, as it has done for the last 12 years, the marriage rate dropped for the first time in 16 years.

The national fertility rate, which mea ures the number of births per thousand women in the childÅ]bearing period between 15 to 44 years of age, continued to decline in the United States in 1974, but only by 1 per cent. Between 1970 and 1973, the average annual drop has beenÅ] 7 per cent, with the 1973 rates plunging to 1 children per family, the lowest points in history --- substantially below the population Ågreplacement levelÅh of 2.1 children.

In 1974, also for the first time since 1970, the numbers of nationwide births rose, although only by 29,000, or I per cent. Both the numbers of births and the rate increased over 1973, the center said, because the population increase of women in the childÅ]bearing years more than offset the decline in the childÅ]bearing rate. There are now 46.2 million women in the childbearing ages, up about 1 million, or 2 per cent, over 1973. This group will increase according to Census Bureau projections by another 12 per cent by 1980.

In the first annual decrease in marriages since 1958, the nearly 2.2 million marriages performed in 1974 were 54,000, or 2.4 per cent fewer, than in 1973. The marriage rate also dropped, the center said, Ågin spite of an increased population at marriageable ages.Åh The median age for marriage for the male in 1971, the latest figures available, was 22.2 years; for the female, 20.3.

A nationwide phenomenon, the center said, was the decline in the annual number of marriages in 36 states. Those with the biggest decline in marriages were California, down 10,787 from 1974, and Pennsylvania, down 8,701. There were also 7,788 fewer New Yorkers married in 1974.

The only state with a significant increase in marriage licenses was Texas, which had 4,749 more than in 1973.

Spokesmen for the marriage and divorce branch of the center said that both Ågtraditionally decline in times of economic hardship,Åh but the provisional statistics released today contradicted this thesis for divorces.

Of an estimated 970,000 divorces throughout the nation in 1974, 57,000 of them, or 6.2 per cent, exceeded the 1973 level, and were 135 per cent higher, or 557,000 than the divorces recorded in 1962, the year before the upward curve in divorce was firgt observed.

The trend toward more divorces, like less marriages, was national in scope, with only seven states, including New Jersey, reporting fewer than the previous year. New Yorkers filed for divorce 7,024 more times than they did in 1973.

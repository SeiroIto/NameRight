\section{Data}


















\subsection{Data source}

For the US, there are a few data sources on marriages and divorces. 
\begin{description}
\vspace{1.0ex}\setlength{\itemsep}{1.0ex}\setlength{\baselineskip}{12pt}
\item[NHGIS (IPUMS)]	Marriage related data sets. 
\item[NBER]	 A project that compiled marriage and divorce data between 1968-1988 {\footnotesize (\url{https://www.nber.org/research/data/marriage-and-divorce-data-1968-1995-0})}. Marriage data is individual couple entries of \num{12055875} cases. It is sample information and a sampling weight is attached to each entry.
\item[FRED]	FRED (data portal of St. Louis Fed) releases state level population estimates by year since 1900 {\footnotesize (\url{https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=118&eid=259194&od=1960-01-01#} for 1960)}. The code is \texttt{SS}POP where \texttt{SS} is state FIPS code and can use API to download for all periods.
\item[SEER]	NIH-NCI (National Cancer Institutue) releases county level population (by age and sex) estimates between 1969-2020. {\footnotesize\url{https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/download.html}}

There are a few notable points we see in these figures:
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{1.0ex}\setlength{\itemsep}{1.0ex}\setlength{\baselineskip}{12pt}
\item	Irrespective of differences in sampling schemes (census vs. sample), the numbers broadly do not show jumps that may cause alerts. 
\item	Except for a few states, marriage and divorce reporting started well before the changes in women's name rights. Data coverage is long enough to pick up a change, or a lack thereof.
\item	Number of marriages (and divorces) are increasing due possibly to population growth.
\item	Economic downturns may cause marriages to decrease, as we see in 1975. Such a temporary decrease seems to be shared among all the states. 
\item	Economic downturns do not seem to decrease the number of divorces.
\item	When we look at ratios against youth population (defined as ages 15-40),  in the long run, marriage rates are decreasing while the divorce rates are increasing.
\end{itemize}




\section{Legal cases and political activities}

\subsection{Legal cases}



In the US before the 1960's, it was considered that women need to bear husbands' surnames. In \textit{Chapman v. Phoenix National Bank} of 1881\footnote{85 N.Y. 437, 449 (1881). The plaintiff purchased stock in the Phoenix National Bank before her marriage under her maiden name. When US Marshalls seized her asset, she sued on the ground that it held the assets under her maiden name, not her legal name, which is her husband's surname. NY Court of Appeals accepted the plaintiff's claim despite no reference to any law. }: 
\begin{quotation}
For several centuries, by the common law among all English speaking people, a woman, upon her marriage, takes her husband's surname. That becomes her legal name, and she ceases to be known by her maiden name. By that name she must sue and be sued, make and take grants and execute all legal documents. Her maiden surname is absolutely lost, and she ceases to be known thereby. 
\end{quotation}
The lack of legal foundation in this legal interpretation was explicitly noted in the 1960's as in State ex \textit{rel. Krupa v. Green}, 177 N.E. 2d 616, 619 (Ohio App. 8 Dist. 1961). In \textit{Forbush v. Wallace} of Alabama in 1971, the District Court for Middle District of Alabama's denied the woman's right to choose her maiden name upon obtaining driver's license, which was affirmed without a separate opinion by the Supreme Court in 1972. 

Possibly in tandem with this, in 1971, Department of State's position was negative on the right: ``[t]he legal name of a married woman is her husband's surname.'' In addition, to quote from \textit{Walker v. Jackson}, 391 F. Supp. 1395 (E.D. Ark. 1975), 
\begin{quotation}
[T]he Supreme Court of the United States has recognized that a State may constitutionally require a married woman to use her husband's surname as her own for certain purposes, as for example obtaining a driver's license, if the State has a sufficiently compelling interest in imposing the requirement. \textit{Forbush v. Wallace}, Governor, 405 U.S. 970, 92 S. Ct. 1197, 31 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1972), aff'g without opinion, \textit{Forbush v. Wallace}, Governor, 341 F. Supp. 217 (M.D.Ala.1971).
\end{quotation}


Such a position in public offices have slowly changed. According to \citet[][p.6]{Augustine1997}, legal challenges in the 1970's ``firmly establised that ... her name is unchanged by the fact that marriage had occurred.'' ``By the late 1970's and early 1980's many state legislatures codified a woman's right to name herself.'' 

\textsc{Table \ref{TabAFn18}} is tabulation of cases affirming women's name rights listed by \citet[][fn. 18]{Augustine1997}. The leading case was \textit{Dunn v. Palermo} in Tennessee (1975) that the State Supreme Court affirmed that women can register to vote under her maiden names. Additionally, in 1976, Florida District Court of Appeals noted that women are not compelled to change her name upon marriage (\textit{Marshall v. State}). Another leading case that recognizes the women's right to name is in Nebraska in 1978 (\textit{Simmons v. O'Brien}). In this case, the woman retained her former surnames during the marriage, then filed a divorce (marriage dissolution) to which the District Court denied the appeal because she did not file under husband's surname. The Trial Court reversed the District Court's decision and remanded with directions to accept the filing.

Other scholar notes that a decision in Alabama (\textit{Forbush v. Wallace}) of 1971 that denied the women's name right as a ``case inspired a great deal of subsequent litigation'' \citep[][299]{MacClintock2010}, a 1973 case in Maryland (\textit{Stuart v. Bd. of Supervisors of Elections for Howard County}) served as a guide, and a 1975 decision in Wisconsin (\textit{Kruzel v. Podell}) played a pivotal role across the US (\cite[][fn 4]{MacDougall1985}, \cite[][300]{MacClintock2010}). \textsc{Table \ref{TabMFn9}} lists all the formal cases and informal opinions by state judicial or state attorney generals affirming the right after 1972. In principle, one can date the year when the official common law practice shifted to affirm the right.\footnote{\href{https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/406/359/2143469/}{\textit{Allen v. Lovejoy}}, concluded in October 1975, however, notes that a woman who was suspended without pay due to noncompliance with Health Department's name change policy should not get compensation because she did not follow Department's advice to first change the name and appeal to the internal Merit System Council. Given the uncertainty of how MSC might have responded to plaintiff's appeal, the women's name right had not been fully protected until 1974 when the suspension was decided. } 

According to \citet[][p.8]{Augustine1997}, state legal codes have been ammended that a married woman has a right to retain her maiden name.\footnote{Louisiana is unique that it takes a civil law perspective that ``[m]arriage does not change the name of either spouse'' \citep[][p.8]{Augustine1997}. }

\subsection{Political activities}

Following is a summary of political activities that promote women's name rights \citep[][fn 5]{MacDougall1985}: 
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{1.0ex}\setlength{\itemsep}{1.0ex}\setlength{\baselineskip}{12pt}
\item	The Center for a Woman's Own Name was established in 1973 after \textit{Kruzel v. Podell} case was appealed, and started distributing \textit{Booklet For Women Who Wish To Determine Their Own Names After Marriage}. 
\item	In 1974, Olympia Brown League was formed to aid women in Milwaukee affected by the lower court's ruling. In 1972, Massachusetts women formed Name-Change at the time of \textit{Forbush} case\footnote{\textit{Forbush v. Wallace} (1972): A supreme court case that conceded that a woman's legal name is her husband's name. }. They also distributed a booklet titled \textit{Fact Sheet For Women Who Wish To Retain Their Own Name After Marriage}. 
\item	In 1973, \textit{the Committee To Encourage Richard H. Austin To Give Michigan Women Their Middle Names For The Holidays (CERHA)} was formed with Attorney Jean L. King to support the right of women to obtain drivers' licenses using their birth names as middle names. 
\item	In California, \textit{the Name Choice Center} distributed a fact sheet and promoted the issue with the Attorney General and the Legislature. The Center had a mailing list of over 15,000 by 1974. 
\item	In 1974, \textit{The Women's Legal Defense Fund} in Washington, D.C. established a committee
on names which published and distributed a booklet on women's names for D.C. area residents. 
\end{itemize}

The legal origins of woman's name rights in the US

# Abstract

* The US follows the English common law tradition.  
* The common law of England affirms woman's name rights except for fraudulent purposes or in the presence of statutes ruling otherwise. 
* *Therefore,* there is no legal ground for rejecting the claim of women to use their maiden names after marriage for all the purposes.

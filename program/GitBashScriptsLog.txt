## Need to change master to main to be consistent with GitHub (default is "main")
mihot@LAPTOP-NQF56JV9 MINGW64 /c/data/NameRight (master)
$ git branch -m master main

## Something is wrong, I cannot push.
mihot@LAPTOP-NQF56JV9 MINGW64 /c/data/NameRight (main)
$  git push -u origin main
To https://github.com/SeiroIto/NameRight.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/SeiroIto/NameRight.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes

## I force the push.
